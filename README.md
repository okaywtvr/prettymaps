# Pretty Maps

## Abtract

This is basically a working python environment and jupyter notebook for utilizing [prettymaps](https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps) by [Marcelo Prates](https://marceloprates.github.io/generative-art/). The original enviornment and instructions don't seem to work in python 3.10, either because of depricated or updated packages. Regardless, the enviornment included here works for me and may be useful for others intersted in trying out this really cool generative art tool.

## Notes

- While the notebook works, a few deprecation warnings will be outputted.
